      question: "Is steam cleaning safe for my car's paint?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Our steam cleaning method is actually gentler on your paint than traditional washing. The steam lifts dirt without abrasive scrubbing, preserving your clear coat and reducing micro-scratches."
    },
    {
      question: "How much water do you actually use?",
      answer: "We use just 1-2 liters per vehicle compared to 150+ liters for a traditional car wash. That's a 98-99% reduction in water usage!"
    },
    {
      question: "Can steam cleaning remove tough stains and grime?",
      answer: "Yes! The high-temperature steam (150Â°C) effectively breaks down even stubborn dirt, grease, and road grime without harsh chemicals. It's excellent for wheels, engine bays, and interior stains."
    },
    {
      question: "Does steam cleaning sanitize the interior?",
      answer: "Absolutely. The high-temperature steam kills bacteria, viruses, and dust mites, making it ideal for sanitizing seats, carpets, and other surfaces without using chemical disinfectants."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a steam wash take?",
      answer: "Most vehicles take between 45-90 minutes depending on size and condition. We work efficiently but thoroughly to ensure every part of your vehicle receives proper attention."
